    Dear Students, Parents, and Visitors,

    My vision to push this institution to the Zenith of excellence by providing best infrastructure and class
          teaching facilities to aspiring students and transforming them the world class techno professionals.
          Development of infrastructure in rural area with standard educational input is very difficult for three
          reasons.One it is not economically viable. Second-Even after handsomme salary payment, good teachers are not
          available and Thirdly-children from good family background in sufficient number are not available.
          Even after all these hardship we have been considerably successful to implement good professionals courses to
          the rural children with quality education. I am thankful to System Manager, teachers & guardians for thier
          co-operation to make the dream true. My good wishes for Swaraj dedicated father late Shri Juagal Kishore
          Saxena, a freedom fighter, social worker & ex-chairperson of the society.

    Warm regards,


    Devesh Kumar Saxena

    Director, Subhash Academy
